# Challenge 1.1

## Challenge

There are at least six domain-specific languages used in the [little system I cobbled together](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) to write and publish this book. What are they?

## Solution

The languages Java and C are mentioned in the book but these are general-purpose languages (GPL) and not domain-specific languages (DSL).

The book GitHub repository mentions Dart which is maybe in the grey-zone between GPL and DSL. But then we also find HTML, SCSS, and CSS in the languages listing and these can be counted as DSL.

The README in the GitHub repository mentions make so Makefile is another DSL used. The README also mentions that markdown is used for the text of the book and markup languages counts as DSL.

So to summarize there are the following DSL HTML, SCSS, CSS, Makefile, and markdown. Adding up to 5 different so 1 is missing. Peaked the answer to the challenges to also find out about Jinja2.
